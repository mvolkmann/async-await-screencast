This demonstrates the difference between using Promise then/catch methods
and using ES2017 async/await keywords with functions that return Promises.

To run this:
1. Enter "npm start" to start the server.
2. Enter "npm run promise-client" to run the client that uses Promises.
3. Enter "npm run await-client" to run the client that uses async/await.
